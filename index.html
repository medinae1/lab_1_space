  <h1>Earth</h1>
  <p>The third planet away from the Sun, and the only planet known to harbor life. Water covers 70% of the Earth's crust, and the remaining ~30% is land. The atmosphere
    consists of nitrogen, oxygen, and a small amount of other gases. This plays a crucial role in how life is able to thrive on Earth, as it provides the gases needed for respiration.
    Weather on Earth is influenced many factors including temperature, wind, humidity, and precipitation. The large amounts of water on Earth are split up into five major oceans, and the waves
    that wash upon the beach are influenced by the Moon.
