        <h1>Moon</h1>
        <p>
            The moon is believed to have formed rougly 4.5 billion years ago as the aftermath of an impact between Earth and an object around the size of Mars. Gravity on the Moon is about
            1/6th of Earth's gravity. The Moon has no atmosphere, and thus can experience extreme variations in temperature that can range from  -173°C at night to  127°C during the day. The Moon is tidally 
            locked to the Earth, which means that it rotates on its axis at the same speed it orbits the Earth, which results in humans on Earth only seing the same face of the Moon.
